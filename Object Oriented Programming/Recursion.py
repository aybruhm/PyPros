'''
In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself ("recurse"). 
We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. 
The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).

    result = k + tri_recursion(k - 1)
    print(result)
  else:
    result = 0
  return result
